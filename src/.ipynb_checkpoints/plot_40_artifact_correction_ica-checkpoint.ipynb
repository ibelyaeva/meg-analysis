    "Independent components analysis (ICA) is a technique for estimating\n",
    "independent source signals from a set of recordings in which the source\n",
    "signals were mixed together in unknown ratios. A common example of this is\n",
    "the problem of `blind source separation`_: with 3 musical instruments playing\n",
    "in the same room, and 3 microphones recording the performance (each picking\n",
    "up all 3 instruments, but at varying levels), can you somehow \"unmix\" the\n",
    "signals recorded by the 3 microphones so that you end up with a separate\n",
    "\"recording\" isolating the sound of each instrument?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not hard to see how this analogy applies to EEG/MEG analysis: there are\n",
    "many \"microphones\" (sensor channels) simultaneously recording many\n",
    "\"instruments\" (blinks, heartbeats, activity in different areas of the brain,\n",
    "muscular activity from jaw clenching or swallowing, etc). As long as these\n",
    "various source signals are `statistically independent`_ and non-gaussian, it\n",
    "is usually possible to separate the sources using ICA, and then re-construct\n",
    "the sensor signals after excluding the sources that are unwanted.\n",
